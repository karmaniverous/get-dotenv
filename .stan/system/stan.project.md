# Project Prompt — get-dotenv (assistant instructions)

When updated: 2025-10-16T00:00:00Z

## Scope

This document contains only project-specific assistant instructions that augment the system prompt. All durable product requirements have been moved to:

- .stan/system/stan.requirements.md

Keep requirement statements out of this file; use it solely to guide assistant behavior for this repository.

## Documentation formatting policy (HARD RULE — project-level)

- NEVER manually hard-wrap narrative Markdown or plain text content anywhere in this repository.
- Paragraphs MUST be single logical lines; insert blank lines between paragraphs for structure.
- Only preformatted/code blocks (fenced code, CLI excerpts, YAML/JSON examples) may wrap as needed; lists may use one item per line.
- This policy is enforced during review. If prose is manually wrapped, fix it by unwrapping to single-line paragraphs.
