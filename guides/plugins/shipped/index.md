# Shipped Plugins

The get‑dotenv host ships a small set of plugins that cover common needs:

- AWS — establish a session and optionally forward to the AWS CLI.
- Batch — execute a command across multiple working directories.
- Cmd — execute a single command; includes a parent‑level alias.
- Init — scaffold getdotenv config files and a host‑based CLI skeleton.
- Demo — educational plugin showing context access and subprocess patterns.
