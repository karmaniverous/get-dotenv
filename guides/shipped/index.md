# Shipped Plugins

The get‑dotenv host ships a small set of plugins that cover common needs:

- [aws](./aws.md) - establish a session and optionally forward to the AWS CLI.
- [batch](./batch.md) - execute a command across multiple working directories.
- [cmd](./cmd.md) - execute a single command; includes a parent‑level alias.
- [init](./init.md) - scaffold getdotenv config files and a host‑based CLI skeleton.
